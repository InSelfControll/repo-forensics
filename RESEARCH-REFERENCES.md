# Research References

repo-forensics is original work. Its detection code, correlation rules, scoring, and
architecture were written by **Alex Greenshpun**. The *vulnerability classes and attack
techniques* those detectors look for were, in many cases, first disclosed by other security
researchers. This file credits that prior work, links the primary sources, and records the
live data feeds and standards repo-forensics builds on.

If we implement detection for a technique, the researcher who **disclosed the technique** is
credited here, and the **detector implementation** is repo-forensics. Cataloguing prior work
is not the same as originating it; this file keeps that line clear.

Provenance is git-dated: every scanner's first commit is in this repo's history, so the
"shipped on" dates below are verifiable, not asserted. Sources are listed most recent first.

## A note on provenance

The detection *techniques* here are, wherever noted, the work of the researchers credited above.
repo-forensics' contribution is the working detection: the scanners, the correlation engine, the
scoring, and the signed rule distribution. We credit the source of an idea when we implement it,
and we keep our own findings in this repo's history so the provenance of our own work is equally
clear.
